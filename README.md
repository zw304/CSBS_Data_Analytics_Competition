### Final Report Abstract

Community banks primarily provide services to the local business in the neighborhood communities which will enhance their personal relationship with the customers. This research project studies the influence that the community banks have on the US economy than the other regular banks and to identify the role that community banks play in recent years. 

In this report, ARM and networking, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, decision trees, random forest, and boosting models were fitted to discover whether community banks will continue playing an important role in the United States. From the results of hypothesis testing, for most originating lender states, there is no obvious correlation between forgiveness amount level, current loan approval amount, and the location of business whether the headquarter is in rural or urban areas as well as different income regions, but there are still some states that don't apply this pattern. The significance of the relationship is fully based on the originating lender states. After digging deeply of the machine learning methods, it proves that though income area has a positive correlation, it is the least correlated variable while lender state and community banks are the most influential and positively correlated with the bankâ€™s forgiveness and approval amount, which could give policymakers insights about what specific aspect would let a bank be more financially powerful. 

The main goal of this research project is to provide data-driven insights that would help policymakers, regulators, scholars, and others to understand the performance of community banks during the COVID-19 period. Furthermore, community banks could help small businesses maintain their labor force especially during the pandemic periods.
